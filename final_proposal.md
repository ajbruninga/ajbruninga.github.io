GES 486 Final Proposal
---

My goal for this project is to make a map showing the location and density of farmers'
markets in Maryland. My question is then to determine the best farmers' markets
in the state by calculating their proximity to agricultural land. Theoretically
the best markets will be those closest to the farms themselves. I will get my data
from the Maryland GIS Open Data Catalog (http://data.imap.maryland.gov/).

I am going to incorporate Python, Hexagonal Analysis, and 3D-Mapping in this project.
I will know when I've answered my question when I have a map that depicts values
for all the farmers' markets in some way that they can be compared relative to each
other.
