### Part 2

For part 2 of this lab, I looked at the clustering of people over 65 in Baltimore City neighborhoods. High-High values represent areas with lots of old people near other areas with lots of old people. Low-Low values represent areas with fewer old people near other similar areas. The central High-Low area has a high number of older people and is bordered by areas with relatively few older people. The Moran's I value for this data was 0.34, showing fairly positive autocorrelation in the data and a clustering of older people.

### Part 3

For part 3 I looked at the relationship between house size and resident age in Baltimore City neighborhoods with a bivariate Moran's I map. High-High values represent areas with high house sizes and relatively larger numbers of older people over 65 years old, and the clusters in the northern half of the city coincide with areas people might move to to be out of the inner city but still close. The inner city is in general a Low-Low area because house sizes are small and there are fewer older people there. The Moran's I value for this plot was only 0.04 though, showing little autocorrelation in the data. I guess I'm proud of this because it shows the interaction between two variables, which allows for more interesting combinations and analyses.
